Message-ID: <200809151704.m8FH4bnM024388@unicorn.berlios.de>

Summary: Looks weird with netbook remix

Details: Installed linuxdc++ 1.0.1 on asus eee 900 with a ubuntu eee 8.04.1 operating system. Most windows should maximize with this setup but linux dc++ does not, it just hangs there somewhere near the middle of the screen. It is possible to resize the window but haven't been able to make it fit the screen properly though.

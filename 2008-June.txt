As I can see e.g. in Pidgin or Carrier, application
can detect external (NAT) router IP address, so manual
setting of this IP address is not necessary.

It would be nice to have this feature also in Linux DC++.

	alphabetically
Message-ID: <200806060024.m560OJDq008934@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #13959, was updated on 2008-Jun-05 16:24
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: LinuxDC++
Category: None
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: None
Priority: 5
Submitted by: victorzamanian
Assigned to : none
Summary: Sorting by "speed" sorts speeds alphabetically

Details: Sorting the "Finished downloads" and "Finished uploads" by speed or size seemingly sorts the speeds and sizes by their alphanumeric representations and not by their numeric values.

Expected behavior:
106.48 KiB/s
112.30 KiB/s
1.09 MiB/s

Current behavior:
106.48 KiB/s
1.09 MiB/s
112.30 KiB/s
(seems like points are ignored, too. This is an example of the behavior--longer lists will more clearly show this erroneous behavior.)

Thanks for a great piece of software!

When sorting by Size, the pattern is a bit more indistinguishable to the 2 AM eye... but I can at least say that it doesn't sort correctly by Size.

Hello.
I'm using two local networks with different DC hubs in
each network. With your good DC client i can't "seed"
in both hubs in different networks (except in passive
mode, of course) in same time.
In... other operational system clients this feature
exist long time.

This feature will be extremly useful for me, and for
other users, that have more than one network with DC hubs.

I use this simple bash scroptie to assign public IP to the client 
each time it is restarted. My ISP tends to change IP every 12 
hours, so when this happens Linuxdcpp crashes badly. BUT script 
retrives new address, feeds it to the client and restarts it. quite 
ugly, but working solution. Maybe it would be ok to build such a 
function inside program itself. Script following:
#~/bin/bash
hostname=`hostname`
cd "~/.dc++/"
log="/home/headhunter/.dcpp_crash_log"
#30 is just some value in case it gets stuck on restart-fail cycle.
for (( i=0 ; i<30; i++))
do
        #cut parameters are not a good style, maybe sed would be 
better
        IP=`host $hostname | cut -c 38-`
        echo "running attempt $i with IP $IP" >>$log
        cat DCPlusPlus.xml | head -n 7 > 1.tmp
        echo '          <ExternalIp type="string">'$IP'</ExternalIp>' 
>>1.tmp
        cat DCPlusPlus.xml | tail -n +9 >>1.tmp
        mv 1.tmp DCPlusPlus.xml
        sleep 2
        nice -n 3 linuxdcpp >>$log
done

of course, all debug info goes to log as well as ip's obtained from 
ISP. Good luck, answer directly to email in my profile.

why does DCPP client has to consume so much CPU? i was unable 
to even start it on my old 300 MHz pentium machine wich i use as 
a gate... Very much bad. You ask if i know how to fix it? I hope i 
do - get rid of that damned GTK gui - switch to qt or Ncurses.

Add a global hotkey to show/hide interface.

I propose the following way to do that. When main
window is closed do not stop LinuxDC++, instead hide it
to tray. When new instance is started do not show
message box, instead activate/unhide existing instance.

This behavior is similar to KDE's Kontact.

Subject: [Linuxdcpp-developers] SSL licence exception,
	security issue and debian package..
Message-ID: <200806301051.14747.toots@rastageeks.org>

	Hi all !

I have filed a bug some months ago concerning linuxdcpp's licence violating 
SSL's licence terms when linked against it:
  http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=13782&group_id=2230

This isssue is a major concern for the debian distribution. So far, I was 
waiting for a fix to update again the package, or to drop it for lenny if it 
wasn't fixed on time.

Now, a security bug was filed against linuxdcpp recently:
  http://bugs.debian.org/488630

As a consequence, I will have to shorten the delay for this decision, and make 
it within the next days. If the licence does not get fixed at this moment, I 
will have no choice but to drop linuxdcpp for debian (and possibly ubuntu and 
others..), since the package does not seem to compile without openssl 
instaled in the system:
> Checking for C library crypto... no
>         crypto library not found
>         Note: This library may be a part of libssl on your system
> make: *** [build/linuxdcpp] Erreur 1

It would be very nice if you could fix this issue. It is only a matter of 
adding a single sentence to the licence:
"This program is released under the GPL with the additional exemption that 
compiling, linking, and/or using OpenSSL is allowed."
which is quite straight forward, since the software, indeed, is made to be 
compiled and linked against it...

      We need to encrypt/decrypt packets while sending/receiving using our

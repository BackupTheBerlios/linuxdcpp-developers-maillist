Summary: Segmentation fault

Details: I know I should be giving a detailed report, but currently I do not know what triggers the crash. I'm using the latest CVS version (28/10/2007).

I just keep it running and at some point the icon in my tray disappears. I left the startup open and I noticed that it exits with status 139. And I hope this might help. What I can do a next time (although time is limited for me) is compile it with debug=1, run it and hope it crashes. It has happened now three times over the period of roughly an hour. I hope to have more details later, although I hope that the exit status info might help.

Hello all,

I switched the format of the changelog so that individual changes could be 
associated more easily with their release version. Also, I will be changing how 
I go about doing commits from now on. Instead of doing a large number of changes 
on my local copy then committing them all at once, I will be committing a fix as 
soon I've compiled and tested it. Thus each future CVS commit should only have 
one fix in it. This should allow users to get the very latest fixes and it 
should allow patch writers to create patches on top of the very latest code; 
making my life more easier when I merge their changes ;). If these CVS commit 
emails start spamming the list too often, I will disable them.

Regards,
Steven Sheehy

Summary: Toolbar style should default to the environment setting

Details: From Changelog:
[2007-10-13] Added an option to specify the main toolbar style.

Implementation of this feature actually breaks stuff: LinuxDC++ no longer obeys the same setting I've set in Gnome. This sucks, because I certainly don't want to configure toolbar style for every application I use, and I want at least GTK-based applications to follow the setting I set in a GTK-based environment.

I don't mind LDC++ having this feature, but in such case a "default" setting should be available and defaulted to.

Is there anyway to add icons for those 6 mime type, or to create new ones.
Also we can include them in ShareManager class.
 Another way will be to add those icons only if user use gnome
specifications, to test at compilation time.

Summary: Uploaded/finished records with frozen speed value

Details: When a particular download/upload from/to an user finishes,
the status changes to Done (e.g.) but in Speed column there
is still a last speed value displayed.. so after some time there
are many "dead" values here that confuse user if he wants to
see e.g. highest current speeds (sorted view by Speed column).
Moreover sum of displayed speed values several times exceeds
line capacity which is confusing too.

I'm using Openbox3 as a window manager. It has built-in per-
application configuration which allows me to start each application 
with its own window parameters. I want to force Linux DC++ to start 
in fullscreen mode, accoding to Openbox manual I can identify 
application with WM_CLASS or WM_WINDOW_ROLE.  http://
icculus.org/openbox/index.php/
Help:Applications#Finding_the_class.2C_name_and_role_parameters

If I use WM_CLASS with Linux DC++, the preferences that I want to 
use are also applied to the file open dialog so it is made fullscreen 
too. Can you please define the WM_WINDOW_ROLE variable for the 
Linux DC++ main window? As far as I understand it won't have any 
negative effects for any of ldcpp users, and I hope its not very hard 
to implement.

Thanks!

Message-ID: <98eb9d2a0711171121h69983006ge6c1811bf596b25d@mail.gmail.com>

Hiya!
First time poster. I took myself together and made a few adjustments
to get linuxdc++ to work on mac os x 10.5.
First of, i installed all the deps for linuxdc++ through macports.
works great, except for iconv. This is issued by apple by default
hence a small modification had to be issued so the SConstruct file.
This and a casting problem in Text.cpp is all that was needed. I dont
have a machine with Linux or any other OS so i dont know if this
breaks anything for other people...
Hope someone else finds this usefull.

Im attaching the complete SConstruct and the Text.cpp.

Best Regards
Per G?ransson

        I have created a new patch to add support for old dc clients, that
doesn't use TTH and xml filelist. Please test, maybe you know better where I
have introduce some bugs.
        In windows land are more dc clients from where to choose, maybe this
should be present as separate patch for those where linuxdcpp is only dc
client. At least they should know that it exists.

   Thanks.

All the dependencies for linuxdc++ have been installed through macports.
ld does not like "--as-needed" and iconv had to be modified. Thats all.

Hello,

I'm sorry, but I cannot include your patch in LinuxDC++ for a number of reasons. 
First, you modify the DC++ core (client/). We copy this directory from Windows 
DC++ so any changes to this have to generally be sent upstream first and 
approved there. Secondly, even if you sent this upstream, I know they will 
reject it. Namely because they specifically removed this functionality not too 
long ago. Their intent is to force users to upgrade to newer clients and 
technologies. We intend for LinuxDC++ to be a port DC++ to *nix, thus we try to 
keep our core in sync with theirs as much as we can.

-Steven

Please, add a menu with hub-provided commands, for
example, I am an OP, and I can't use administration menu =(

Subject: [Linuxdcpp-developers] Open file patch
Message-ID: <4745FD9C.9000404@cs.umu.se>

Hi,

this patch (attached) makes it possible to open finished files through 
the default application specified in your favourite desktop environment. 
(In Windows this would be called open by association or something like 
that.)

I'm not satisfied with it yet, but it works. Right now the catch-all 
script 'xdg-open' is hard coded into Wulfor::openURI. I'm open for 
suggestions.

As for error handling, I'm going with a dialog on error. This seems to 
be the first instance of showing a error message dialog in the whole 
program? I'm having trouble accessing the mainwindow pointer, which is 
proper to set when creating modal dialogs. I guess I'm open to 
suggestions on this one too :)

The patch is work-in-progress.

Regards,
David (individ)

Let me translate this for you. And I try to emulate the typos as it really 
brings out the quality of the mail...


Why the f*ck there is an addy: (? couldn't figure out a retarded form for 
address) http://linuxdcpp.berlios.de/document.php?id=1 with a link for 
download?!!! are you a bt dumb satan.remove it! because you can't download 
anything from there (ow... boohoo I can't use CVS (this isn't a part of the 
original mail)) and there's no link to the down load page! satan! 



Ok. The retard aside, Steven I think there really should be a link for the 
1.0.0 source tarballs under the download page. Though I don't think it would 
help much in this case.. Even if the tarball link was embedded within <blink> 
tags...

Instant classic. Brillant! [sic]

Aside from the humor, I too think it's unusually hard to download 1.0. 
But it sets a lower bar...

Message-ID: <430c80e90711250806h50e4c053oe610f88acc35b802@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I've been trying to add some fucntionality to linuxdcpp like getting
the latest files added
 to the hub. I was checking for adding a latest entry in the nickMenu
of glade/linux.glade
and adding a method onLatestItemClicked in hub.cc. I also did a
g_signal_connect for this.

When i compile, no errors are there, but when i run this i get this
error and also there is no
latest entry in the nickMenu.

(linuxdcpp:14953): GLib-GObject-WARNING **: invalid (NULL) pointer instance

(linuxdcpp:14953): GLib-GObject-CRITICAL **: g_signal_connect_data:
assertion `G_TYPE_CHECK_INSTANCE (instance)' failed

Any help will be greatly appreciated!

thanks.

Hi,

I cannot tell what the problem is based on your description. If you attach the 
patch I can probably figure it out.

I applied your patch and it worked fine for me. It didn't display any errors in 
the console and properly called onLatestItemClicked_gui (I added a printout). If 
the dcassert is failing in entry, then that means it can't find latestItem in 
hub.glade on your system for some reason. You probably have some old glade files 
installed in your install prefix and it's using those. Remove all linuxdcpp 
installed files if you're going to run from the current directory.

Hello,
I've implemented the latest added feature to linuxdcpp.
But im not sure if its in the standard.

In our college there is a [BOT]Offliner which keeps track of all the
latest stuff
added to the hub. So, when u send it the latest command it shows u the
latest stuff in that
particular category.

Can this be submitted as a patch for inclusion?

Hello,

I don't think that such a feature is present in very many hubs, so I don't think 
it'd be good for inclusion. In addition, it would seem that such a feature could 
be easily implemented as a user command, instead of the hardcoded approach you 
took. You just need to send the raw command to the bot to request the latest 
info and it should send back the data in the main chat or a pm. All the logic 
should be handled by the bot so there should be need to modify the client as far 
as I can tell. Thank you for the offer, though.

Regards,
Steven

Hi Steven,

The option of sending the raw command is there. But should'nt there be
the GUI option too like in DC++ of windows? We just right click it to
get the latest info unlike having to type the command each time?? It
would be easy for the endusers who dont like to type commands( the
linux way :)

thanks,

There is a gui option which allows you to type it in the preferences once and 
have it show up in the userlist right click menu from then on. If you're not 
using latest cvs you might not see it.

Is there any other way i can get the latest cvs? im behind the
university firewall and we use
a http proxy to connect. It would really be a help if you could help
me get the latest package.

I have used cvsgrab (http://cvsgrab.sourceforge.net/) at times when I've 
been behind a firewall/proxy.

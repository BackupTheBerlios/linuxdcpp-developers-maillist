Message-ID: <200803040645.m246jxqX021189@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #13269, was updated on 2008-Mar-04 12:45

Summary: Slow GUI update

Details: When my p2p users list contains > 3K users (it can reach up to 5K) program GUI begins to update very rarely, I have to wait for several minutes until window begins updating itself.  Uploads and downloads go ok during such time.  I tried to disable all my shares, it helped a little?when number of p2p users increased, I had this problem again.

During users number decrease (down to 1K) GUI begins to behave itself responsive, so I guess it's something related to GUI thread priority.  I understand it may be difficult to optimize the program to work fast with such load, probably I can somehow modify GUI thread priority to sacrifice up/download threads performance (at least when window has focus and isn't minimized)?  Or are there any configuration/compilation options I can use to overcome this?

My PC isn't very fast, it has 1 GHz Intel Celeron processor.

Thanks in advance for all possible feedback.

Summary: Adding usercommand without a name

Details: When adding user commands via Advanced->User commands, if you forget to fill in the name only an error message is shown and the command is discarded. This is annoying. It should either return to the UC editor (with all the fields filled that were before pressing ok) or default the name to something eg. Unnamed%d.

Wow, that makes absolutely no sense at all. If they're going to spam they should 
at least make it readable so it's worth their efforts. :D

Anyway, I set mailman to require admin approval for all messages sent by 
non-members of the mailing list. The list should hopefully not receive anymore 
spam since now I'll be receiving them all. :(

Summary: Context menu for absent users

Details: Context menu for users who have left the hub isn't working correctly. Opening context menu (from chatView obviously) for user that has left really opens context menu for random user (whoever happens to be selected in the nicklist).

Correct behavior would be to disable menuitems that can't be executed for absent user (pretty much everything but copy nick, others require CID which isn't available, right?).

PS. sorry if it seems that I've moved to the complaint department instead of fixing these myself. I probably will fix this when I have time (or get bored on what I'm supposed to be doing), but if someone else wants to fix it, I don't mind.

If you mean unfinished dir then no. Files are first downloaded to the 
unfinished folder and after that moved to the destination dir if it has free 
space. ^w^w^w... Actually, I'm not sure how it behaves if you leave the 
unfinished dir empty. If I remember correctly older DC++ versions downloaded 
directly to the destination in case of empty unfinished  dir. Current 
versions might just default to the home dir/.dc++ if empty. So you could try 
that and see what happens. 

If it's not the unfinished dir what you're after then I'm not sure if I 
understand the question. Because you don't have to change the download dir to 
dl to a different partition. You can browse for the destination or set-up 
predefined alternative locations for download.

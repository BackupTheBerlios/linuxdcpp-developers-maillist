Summary: Automatic Auto-Away on Minimize not working

Details: Auto-away on minimize does not work.

I minimize the application and expect my client to be set in the /away mode thus responding with the preconfigured /away message to PM and being visible as being "away" by hubsofts and other clients that look for such a thing.

However, this is not the case. Recently discovered and verified by minimizing the client and using a different client to send a PM to linuxdcpp client, receiving no away response.
Sending from hubsoft generates no response either and if I look at the tags there's nothing there indicating that I'm away. (Gotta be something there, as clients such as AirDC see certain status info about other clients, marking them with different colors for e.g. away status.)

Sorry for my slightly long-winded explanation but it's late and I'm sleepy and just wanted to make sure you realized that I've tried everything short of completely reinstalling from CVS and nothing works to enable the "auto-away on minimize" feature.
If I set my /away status manully, everything seems to be working fine.

Hi!

I'd like to make a cosmetic suggestion for the tab
handling. It becomes a little cumbersome to manage when
there are more tabs than what fit on the width of the
application window. You don't see the bold:ing of tabs
outside the window width and when you scroll back to
check them they are un-bolded upon selection, so with
30 windows that makes for having to actually look at
the text to see if there's anything new there.
Either way, it's just not as efficient as having, say,
two rows of tabs, or having them show up in a drop-down
list like with the FireFox "Links" bar (or having the
option of making it a drop-down or two rows would be
even cooler. And automatically create a drop-down for
the surplus tabs once width exceeds two rows.)
Also, making the tabs smaller and with smaller print
would fit more of them in the window.

And a functions request (don't know if this is a bug or
just the way match queue was designed)
I can't seem to select multiple sources (search hits)
and match queue from the search results. Since I have
to disable "auto-match queue for search hits" I would
like to be able to just select a few of the hits and
match their queues. The option is greyed out when
selecting more than one hit at a time. Tedious doing
them one at a time if you need to match for 20 hits or so.

Oh, and are there any plans of extending the scripting
capabilities in LinuxDC++? Would be nice to be able to
have some OP-client like features, like client tag
checking + actions, fake file checking, virus
files/unallowed files, that sort of stuff.
Can't seem to do much with the commands feature as,
again, there are limitations and the %[UserNI] doesn't
work here.

Hi!

It'd be nice if we could add custom commands to the
right-click menu that is displayed in the transfer
window, ie when you right-click on a transfer.
(e.g. "copy nick/IP/file name" etc from the active
transfer)

..and other features on a right-click menu.

It'd be nice to be able to grant extra slots or add
custom commands menus to the right-click inside a PM
window (for instance if I want to perform a custom
command action on someone I'm currently in a PM session
with, as it is now, I have to find out which hub he's
on -which it would be nice if it said in the actual
window and not only on the tab label, say maybe at the
top somewhere where it's always visible- I have to
navigate through the user list with the lacking
user/nick search (see my previous post on making that a
"free text search") and only then can I perform a
command on the user. Since I can't issue commands by
typing them in the PM window either and since the tab
display and navigation is a little cluttered, this
becomes very repetitive, tedious and generates  much
more mouse-work than necessary. 
(Granted I can switch tabs with the keyboard but that
cycles through them all which removes the bolding and
then I lose track of which windows had new actions in them)

Hello,

We were actually waiting on the DC++ core to finish switching to gettext so we 
can have a fully translated program. I think they just finished the switch last 
week, now we just need a stable release from them that includes these changes. 
The actual GUI part of the program does support gettext. I've gone through the 
entire source and added _() around all translatable strings, although it still 
may be missing some strings and we need to check if any strings have positional 
arguments and handle accordingly.

Any help you can give would be greatly appreciated in this regard. For now we 
can't do anything with the core (e.g. the client/ folder), but until that time 
we can get the GUI translated (since the core will have separate POT files 
anyway). We can probably copy a lot of the l18n infrastructure code from DC++ 
(pot, po, mo generation, etc.) since they also use scons. Let me know what you 
think.

Thanks,
Steven

Here's a link to some documentation for user commands:

http://dcplusplus.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/*checkout*/dcplusplus/dcplusplus/trunk/help/settings_usercommands.html?revision=840

It would be great if someone could make a patch to add a help dialog to the user 
commands dialog with this info.

Hello.

Attached is the patch that adds an ability
to search by the magnet links.
I know the attitude to this approach here,
but I couldn't help writing it. Without
that patch the announced magnet support is
basically useless and that have to be fixed.

Would it be possible to get it applied?

Summary: [PATCH] System tray icon causes BadMatch-crash in KDE4

Details: It seems to be some issue with GTK+KDE4 and system tray (afaik (after googling) something about RGBA [1]).
This patch (appended) is a quick fix that stops the crashing. At least so you can enter the settings panel and disable the system tray icon.

The only thing I realized is that most people
here do not CC to the original poster, and so
I missed the previous replies from you and
Max Lapan.
Now I have read those too.
As for trolling - well, I am not sure what are
you referring to. I was saying that the magnet
support was incomplete and for the most real
uses even non-existant. Let me demonstrate this
with an example. There is a movie catalog in a
LAN but it only has the magnet links within.
You download linuxdcpp and find that you cant
feed the magnet links to it. After spending the
whole day you may or may not find out that you
need to post the link to the chat and then click
it to get searched.

I am not subscribed to this list, so please CC
your next brain surgery to my mail address.

Well you can discuss me if you want, but without
saying a word about the patch itself, it is probably
not very usefull either. :)

> Such a command line option will be a plus.
Aparently Steven does not agree because it would
not be possible to use it when dc is already running.
So I have not implemented this.
I am also unsure how will it work if you have
no hubs configured for autoconnect.

I say what I think. The patch adds a low-level support
which is very good and valueable for developers, but
for the end-user like me the lowlevel support without
an interface support is a pure nothing. This doesn't
mean the guys did the bad work (and without their work
my patch would not be possible either) but surely it was
not complete. What I am trying to say is _only_ that
adding the proper interface support is a must when the
lowlevel support is already there. Otherwise the great
work done by those who added the lowlevel support may
be completely nullified by the lack of that effort.
After all, everything is done for the end-user, so he
judges.

I am not unless some improvements are suggested.
The patch is small and works as expected.
I am not 100% sure but I think Steven said
quite explicitly that he doesn't like that
approach. So I coded up that patch mainly
for my own use and posted it here just in case.
Of course the explicit confirmation from Steven
would be nice to make all the doubts go away. :)

I initially thought about implementing both.
But in a private conversation Max explained
me that implementing such a dialog would not
be easy. It will require adding a magnet support
to the dc core so that you can queue multiple
magnets and they'll search in a background and
then start downloading automatically.
I don't need to queue multiple magnets so I
went an easy path. Yet I see it usefull for
someone else so I don't think the idea itself
was too bad.

> I proposed the

I never argued against a new search option, here's
the quote:
---
But I guess also some
GUI additions are needed. Like the explicit
"Open magnet link" dialog somewhere and maybe
a new search option.
---
I still think both are nice to have, but the
first is simply isn't worth an efforts while the
second is done.

You miss the point. Usually, if a patch gets applied to the main tree,
the person who submitted it takes the responsibility for maintaning that
piece of code, it is a common practice everywhere. Better be on-line then
and aware of any changes.

And I am not sure that I have seen that kind of reaction here.

As far as I understand, it was basically
said that any way of directly entering a
magnet link is discouraged in favour of
registering linuxdcpp as the URI handler
in a platform-independant way (and I am
not even aware about a truly platform-
independant way of doing that, the one that
can work on windows, macos and *nix for
instance).
But that was just my interpretation, I may
very well be wrong with it. So lets just
wait and see.
I myself am of course ready to do whatever
the modifications are necessary to get it applied.

Subject: [Linuxdcpp-developers] [Bug #13195] ver. 1.0.1 crash if receive an
	empty msg body in "$To:"
Message-ID: <200802241501.m1OF1hbl019042@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #13195, was updated on 2008-Feb-24 16:01
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: LinuxDC++
Category: None
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: None
Priority: 5
Submitted by: antanius
Assigned to : none
Summary: ver. 1.0.1 crash if receive an empty msg body in "$To:"


Details: the application crashes with the following error:

terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::out_of_range'
  what():  basic_string::substr

the problem happens when the client receives a "$To:" with 
an empty message body.

I have fixed with:

File: NmdcHub.cpp
699c701,705
<               string msg = param.substr(j + 2);
---
>               j+=2;   
>               if(j >param.size())
>                       j=param.size();
>               
>               string msg = param.substr(j);

bye

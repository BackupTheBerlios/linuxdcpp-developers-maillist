Subject: [Linuxdcpp-developers] suggestion - open with
Message-ID: <430c80e90712011057h5079c7e3j94fa029b9dee2d58@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
when u right click a downloaded file in the finished downloads tab,
we get an option of "open with" which asks for a command.

Now, can't we implement something such that we have an option
of opening it with the default command for that type of file?
I think this is easy to implement and would really be helpful.

Also, cant we implement the "open downloads directory" command?

regards,

Subject: [Linuxdcpp-developers] Download queue by TTH - not filename
Message-ID: <430c80e90712030215u5a2c83a5l4b8f35f087e53e74@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I've noticed that when two files with the same TTH but diff filenames
are clicked,
we get these two files with same TTH in the download queue.
This is a problem when we try to download a file from a user with
no slots. We then search for the file using "Search for alternates"
which searches
using TTH. This lists out files with same TTH and diff file names.
When we select a
file from this alternate list with a different filename, we should get
only one file in
the download queue.
I suggest we populate the download queue after searching the existing
queued files
and try to match the TTH. If we get a slot from other user, we first
remove the previous
file and then add this new file to the download queue.

Any suggestions?

Hope u understood this.

thanks,

Yup, needs xdg-utils. Please put a check in the SConscript file for xdg-utils.

Just enable auto search for alternative locations and match queue for search 
hits. If you don't want the same TTHs added more than once when clicking 
results you can try to enable don't dowload files already in the queue (I 
guess it fixes that, though I think it's rather funny name for the option). 

If you want to keep manually adding the search hits there should list of 
matching TTH targets in the download to -menu.

Summary: Hub-linked chat doesn't seem to work

Details: I connect to a hub-linked network.  (I don't know if that makes a difference, but I'm "firewalled with forwarding".)  I can download fine, and I can chat normally with people on the same hub as me, but I don't see any chat from other hubs.  It does work for people using DC++ on Windows.

One of the two things i can't live without, but
unfortunately have to right now without windows again.
Is the highlight function that fuldc uses. It colours
the field of a directory/file when browsing a users
filelist if you already have it in your own share.

It is simply a must have, which i hope could be
arranged. I'd help if given instructions. :)

Now the second thing i miss the most is the function
that allows you to have for example
/home/nissepisse1/music & /media/nissepisse2/music
under the same virtual name in your share.

/home/1 = virtual name: music
/home/2 = virtual name: music

This would be a really good thing to have. With alot of
things to share, you can't fit all in 1 drive, so you
have to divide it. But when you share it you want it
under the same name.

I know fuldc uses this if any help can be found in
those src files. I'll gladly help if given instructions.

miks vitussa osotteessa's eloquent exposition has convinced me that I must 
update the download page. I added the links to the source tarballs on that page. 
  I hope I don't have to change that site anymore as it is truly awful (both the 
design and the process I have to use to update it). Anyways, hopefully that helps.

Message-ID: <200712140724.lBE7OnpZ021644@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #12714, was updated on 2007-Dec-14 09:24

Summary: Patch for support of older clients' file lists

Details: Hello,
Since most of the networks have 90+% of users with older clients, and DC++/linuxdcpp are incompatible with their file lists format, a friend of mine created a patch that re-includes support for compatibility with them, as it was in the older versions.

You can find the patch here:
https://bugs.gentoo.org/attachment.cgi?id=138376
There is also the gentoo bugzilla bug#202101 that could include this patch in the gentoo distribution if denied by the upstream (hopefully not).

Best regards,
Cristi

Subject: [Linuxdcpp-developers] [PATCH] cursor over tags update
Message-ID: <20071215165528.GA21505@shota.mine.nu>

Hello,

The gui code that treats urls or other tags in hub chat and PM windows does
not work properly. When moved over the active text (tag) the cursor either does
not change at all or changes in an unpredictable manner, or stays as hand after
a click and moving the pointer off the tag, etc. 

Therefore, I have changed its logic so that it is now somewhat intermediate
between the original code of the magnet patch and Steven's code.

It was also clear that there was some duplication of code in hub.cc and
privatemessage.cc. I decided not to touch this and I simply edited the
code in both places.

The patch is attached.

Also, to extract the tarball and it doesn't put inside linuxdcpp-1.0.1,  
which it extracts all over in my folder. I had to create linuxdcpp-1.0.1  
folder first and extract inside linuxdcpp-1.0.1. Anyway, the permission  
issues are on near all of files in the tarball.

Subject: [Linuxdcpp-developers] LinuxDC++ refuse to exit,
	backtrace available.
Message-ID: <op.t37ugpwx9aq2h7@mezz.mezzweb.com>

Hello,

For some reason, LinuxDC++ refuse to exit. If I click on close or quit  
button, the interface will disappear but the LinuxDC++ still runs hide. I  
had to kill it by manual. I have ran LinuxDC++ in gdb and kill it by  
manual to get the backtraces.

FreeBSD 7.0-BETA4
glib-2.14.4
gtk-2.12.3
linuxdcpp-1.0.1

Backtrace: http://people.freebsd.org/~mezz/gdb/gdb-linuxdcpp.txt

Cheers,
Mezz

Subject: [Linuxdcpp-developers] Moved to Launchpad
Message-ID: <48951DD9.7000607@gmail.com>

LinuxDC++ has moved project hosting from Berlios to Launchpad. The Berlios site 
will stay up awhile until bugs and feature requests can be transferred or 
closed. We would request that all new bugs be opened on the Launchpad site. The 
new website is located at:

https://launchpad.net/linuxdcpp

Subject: [Linuxdcpp-developers] I want to log incoming searches on client.
Message-ID: <cd1a57e60808140639q3dd8175fs3b72cb741ca9c53a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I grabbed the 1.0.2 linuxdcpp source code and was able to build it. For a
particular project, I need to log every search request that comes in, along
with the IP and time to an SQLite database.

If you can point me to the function that's called when a search is recieved,
I can extract the right data and log it. I'm guessing I need to look in
SearchManager.cpp.

Thank you.
Anirudh

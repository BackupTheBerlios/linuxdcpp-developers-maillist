Hi!

I'd like to make a cosmetic suggestion for the tab
handling. It becomes a little cumbersome to manage when
there are more tabs than what fit on the width of the
application window. You don't see the bold:ing of tabs
outside the window width and when you scroll back to
check them they are un-bolded upon selection, so with
30 windows that makes for having to actually look at
the text to see if there's anything new there.
Either way, it's just not as efficient as having, say,
two rows of tabs, or having them show up in a drop-down
list like with the FireFox &quot;Links&quot; bar (or having the
option of making it a drop-down or two rows would be
even cooler. And automatically create a drop-down for
the surplus tabs once width exceeds two rows.)
Also, making the tabs smaller and with smaller print
would fit more of them in the window.

And a functions request (don't know if this is a bug or
just the way match queue was designed)
I can't seem to select multiple sources (search hits)
and match queue from the search results. Since I have
to disable &quot;auto-match queue for search hits&quot; I would
like to be able to just select a few of the hits and
match their queues. The option is greyed out when
selecting more than one hit at a time. Tedious doing
them one at a time if you need to match for 20 hits or so.

Oh, and are there any plans of extending the scripting
capabilities in LinuxDC++? Would be nice to be able to
have some OP-client like features, like client tag
checking + actions, fake file checking, virus
files/unallowed files, that sort of stuff.
Can't seem to do much with the commands feature as,
again, there are limitations and the %[UserNI] doesn't
work here.

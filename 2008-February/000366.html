<PRE>Hello.

</I>The only thing I realized is that most people

I missed the previous replies from you and
Max Lapan.
Now I have read those too.
As for trolling - well, I am not sure what are
you referring to. I was saying that the magnet
support was incomplete and for the most real
uses even non-existant. Let me demonstrate this
with an example. There is a movie catalog in a
LAN but it only has the magnet links within.
You download linuxdcpp and find that you cant
feed the magnet links to it. After spending the
whole day you may or may not find out that you
need to post the link to the chat and then click
it to get searched.

</I>I am not subscribed to this list, so please CC
your next brain surgery to my mail address.

</I>&gt;<i> Hm. Seems that the patient has not fully recovered yet :)
</I>Well you can discuss me if you want, but without
saying a word about the patch itself, it is probably
not very usefull either. :)

&gt;&gt;<i> magnet links, and the command-line argument
</I>&gt;<i> Such a command line option will be a plus.
</I>Aparently Steven does not agree because it would
not be possible to use it when dc is already running.
So I have not implemented this.
I am also unsure how will it work if you have
no hubs configured for autoconnect.

&gt;<i> Stas, we are both russians so we know very well what does that mean

</I>&gt;<i> a role

</I>&gt;<i> patch you should get an idea that the interface part of it was a
</I>&gt;<i> secondary
</I>&gt;<i> thing when copared to the other more low-level tasks the patch does.
</I>I say what I think. The patch adds a low-level support
which is very good and valueable for developers, but
for the end-user like me the lowlevel support without
an interface support is a pure nothing. This doesn't
mean the guys did the bad work (and without their work
my patch would not be possible either) but surely it was
not complete. What I am trying to say is _only_ that
adding the proper interface support is a must when the
lowlevel support is already there. Otherwise the great
work done by those who added the lowlevel support may
be completely nullified by the lack of that effort.
After all, everything is done for the end-user, so he
judges.

<PRE>Hello.

this is no longer a problem.

The patch is small and works as expected.
I am not 100% sure but I think Steven said
quite explicitly that he doesn't like that
approach. So I coded up that patch mainly
for my own use and posted it here just in case.
Of course the explicit confirmation from Steven
would be nice to make all the doubts go away. :)

</I>&gt;<i> I think it was good you dropped your original idea of adding yet

</I>&gt;<i> dialog and instead implemented it as a search option.
</I>I initially thought about implementing both.
But in a private conversation Max explained
me that implementing such a dialog would not
be easy. It will require adding a magnet support
to the dc core so that you can queue multiple
magnets and they'll search in a background and
then start downloading automatically.
I don't need to queue multiple magnets so I
went an easy path. Yet I see it usefull for
someone else so I don't think the idea itself
was too bad.

&gt;<i> I proposed the
</I>&gt;<i> same in my reply to your original message (which you did not (want to)
</I>&gt;<i> read).
</I>I never argued against a new search option, here's
the quote:

But I guess also some
GUI additions are needed. Like the explicit
&quot;Open magnet link&quot; dialog somewhere and maybe
a new search option.
---
I still think both are nice to have, but the
first is simply isn't worth an efforts while the
second is done.

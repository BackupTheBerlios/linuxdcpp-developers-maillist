Text::convert() already translates between utf-8 and &quot;something&quot; and vice versa. 
My point was that &quot;something&quot; is not acp (AKA what windows calls the system 
charset). Thus worrying about the value of Text::systemCharset is pointless 
because it is never passed to iconv(). If you're saying that you're thinking 
about how it might be useful in the future if it does become used with iconv(), 
then I can understand why it would be necessary. Before I ever committed the 
encoding  fixes, I had code to remove the country &amp; language code from ctype but 
I chose to remove it at that time.

</I>&gt;<i> Well, memleak is actually something different: it is when the amount

</I>
Not so. A memory leak is when a program fails to release memory when it's no 
longer needed. It makes no difference if it is done only once at startup or over 
and over during run-time. Every call to malloc() (and functions that call malloc 
like stringdup and new) must have a corresponding free() (or delete). The 
pointer char *s is allocated memory, but that pointer to the memory is then 
lost. Thus you have memory on the heap that can no longer be reached and can't 
be re-used since it's still marked as active. _This_ is a memory leak. What you 
stated can be the _result_ of a memory leak that occurs over and over. Also, 
from wikipedia: &quot;Note that constantly increasing memory usage is not necessarily 
evidence of a memory leak.&quot;

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, this is a  C++ program, so it's better to do string manipulation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using the stl than string.h.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just a matter of preference, but OK.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
It's not a matter of preference, it's a matter of standardization.

&gt;<i> &gt; The attached patch solves this in the following way. First, the peer nick is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stored on the list of expected connections in ACP, not in uft-8. This is not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a problem, because the stored nick is just a key and is not used for any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other purpose. Next, when UserConnection::on() receives $MyNick it is passed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; further untranslated. Peer's nick gets translated to utf-8 later inside
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ConnectionManager::on(MyNick) when it becomes possible to determine and set
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the correct encoding.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This all can be seen directly from the patch, of course. Perhaps, a better
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; way of doing things could be to separate incomming connection checking from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ConnectionManager::on(MyNick) and put it in UserConnection::on() or do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something similar.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yep, this is a definite problem. I could've swore I searched for all calls to 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;new UserConnection&quot; and ensured that setEncoding() was called on it, but I 
</I>&gt;<i> guess I missed one. Your approach is valid, but I would prefer to see it done 
</I>&gt;<i> differently. It would be better to store the exact acp nick that initially comes 
</I>&gt;<i> over the socket somewhere so that it can be retrieved later. Going from acp -&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> utf-8 -&gt; acp could potentially produce a different string from the initial string.
</I>
Hm. If this is so, then we are in a real trouble, because such conversions
from acp -&gt; utf-8 -&gt; acp are all over the place ;)

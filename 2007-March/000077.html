I had originally planned to get a release out late last year, but I had to fix 
two major problems first that delayed any such plans. The first was charset 
support, which took me a lot longer than anticipated since I had to change a 
huge portion of the dcpp core and get it accepted upstream. Now I'm trying to 
add i18n support, but again the dcpp core is giving me huge problems (doesn't 
work with gettext). I have to work with dcpp's maintainer in order to come up 
with a solution, then implement it.

So the only thing holding back a release is the incomplete i18n support, which 
could take one or two months more to complete (at my slow pace, anyway). At that 
time, I will either release a 1.0 beta or a 1.0 (haven't decided which; we've 
basically been in alpha and/or beta for 2 years now). This is probably not the 
time frame you were wanting, but it's the truth. You can try pointing out to 
them it's both in Gentoo and Debian and see if that helps them accept it. Also, 
they no doubt have ffmpeg in their repository which, like us, doesn't make releases.

</I>&gt;<i> UserConnection::on() receives this, blindly translates peerNick_in_acp to

</I>&gt;<i> because the translation fails and the peer is not found in the list of
</I>&gt;<i> expected connections.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here goes an example session (text below contains russian chars):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> NmdcHub::connect &#1058;&#1088;&#1077;&#1083;&#1100;&#1085;&#1080;&#1082;
</I>&gt;<i> NmdcHub::connectToMe &#1058;&#1088;&#1077;&#1083;&#1100;&#1085;&#1080;&#1082;
</I>&gt;<i> BufferedSocket::accept() 0x86d2a00
</I>&gt;<i> BufferedSocket::run() start 0x86d2a00
</I>&gt;<i> ConnectionManager::onMyNick 0x86974e0, ________
</I>&gt;<i> Unknown incoming connection from ________
</I>&gt;<i> BufferedSocket::run() end 0x86d2a00
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In this example, the system locale was ru_RU.UTF-8, but the hub charset was CP1251.
</I>&gt;<i> If someone thinks that setting locale to CP1251 will solve the problem, then it
</I>&gt;<i> is not so, because there always will be hubs with different encodings and we
</I>&gt;<i> want linuxdcpp operate _simultaneously_ on all of them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The attached patch solves this in the following way. First, the peer nick is
</I>&gt;<i> stored on the list of expected connections in ACP, not in uft-8. This is not
</I>&gt;<i> a problem, because the stored nick is just a key and is not used for any
</I>&gt;<i> other purpose. Next, when UserConnection::on() receives $MyNick it is passed
</I>&gt;<i> further untranslated. Peer's nick gets translated to utf-8 later inside
</I>&gt;<i> ConnectionManager::on(MyNick) when it becomes possible to determine and set
</I>&gt;<i> the correct encoding.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This all can be seen directly from the patch, of course. Perhaps, a better
</I>&gt;<i> way of doing things could be to separate incomming connection checking from
</I>&gt;<i> ConnectionManager::on(MyNick) and put it in UserConnection::on() or do
</I>&gt;<i> something similar.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Yep, this is a definite problem. I could've swore I searched for all calls to 
&quot;new UserConnection&quot; and ensured that setEncoding() was called on it, but I 
guess I missed one. Your approach is valid, but I would prefer to see it done 
differently. It would be better to store the exact acp nick that initially comes 
over the socket somewhere so that it can be retrieved later. Going from acp -&gt; 
utf-8 -&gt; acp could potentially produce a different string from the initial string.

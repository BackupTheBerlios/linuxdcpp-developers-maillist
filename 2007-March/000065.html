 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Text::getSystemCharset() is never passed to iconv()
 &gt;&gt;&gt; If, and only if, Text::convert() is used to translate between utf-8
 &gt;&gt;&gt; and something (in both directions). I understood that you added
 &gt;&gt;&gt; iconv() to treat more general case.
 &gt;&gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; I reread what you said and I think I understand what you mean now. You're 
saying
 &gt;&gt; its value would matter if the to and from charsets passed to Text::convert()
 &gt;&gt; were Text::systemCharset and some other charset that isn't utf-8. This would
 &gt;&gt; cause the check to see whether utf8ToAcp/acpToUtf8 should be called to fail and
 &gt;&gt; subsequently iconv_open would be passed Text::systemCharset.
 &gt;
 &gt; Yes, that was what I meant. By the way, I am glad to see that your wording
 &gt; changed from &quot;completely pointless&quot; to &quot;I reread what you said and I think I
 &gt; understand now&quot;. Certain progress is seen.
 &gt;
 &gt;&gt; If you grep the  code, you can see that all calls to Text::convert() are 
currently either
 &gt;&gt; converting from or to utf-8..
 &gt;
 &gt; Yes, true. My point was that if you kept iconv() in the code, then you
 &gt; obviously wanted to use it at a time.
 &gt;
 &gt;&gt; This then brings up the point whether we should switch to nl_langinfo(CODESET)
 &gt;&gt; or stick with setlocale(LC_CTYPE, NULL) if we do this. nl_langinfo() is
 &gt;&gt; supposedly more accurate, but not useable on windows like setlocale().
 &gt;
 &gt; Putting aside the memleak flame, parsing locale string is simple, perhaps,
 &gt; this is an acceptable solution.

Hmmm...seems you are confused on the definition of &quot;flame&quot;, too. It must make 
you feel better to nonchalantly insult others than to admit that you made a mistake.

 &gt;
 &gt; By the way, you have not answered the other mail:

Haven't gotten to it yet.

This is true, we should try to avoid that. Real world network
applications must be liberal in the input they accept, and unfortunately
invalid bytes in strings are commonplace. This problem is especially
real in DC because there are more clients than one can count and most of
them are written without any thought about character encodings. The
protocol also has strings like nicks that are both displayed to the
users and used as identifiers that need to stay the same byte for byte.
The unix filesystem has a similar problem, filenames can contain any
byte sequence except null and /, and filenames are also identifiers and
strings that are displayed to the user.

Reworking the code to avoid conversions except when displaying strings
to users is the most reliable way, but that's quite a big chore. If that
can be achieved easily with this, it's a good beginning and we should go
for it.

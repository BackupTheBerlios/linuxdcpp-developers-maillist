Subject: [Linuxdcpp-developers] SSL licence exception,
 security issue and debian package..

Hi,

It is not so simple as you say. Firstly, since we embed DC++ core code in our 
code instead of linking to it, DC++ would have to change their license as well. 
Secondly, linuxdcpp cannot change the license since we would have to get the 
permission of every person who has ever submitted a patch. We cannot just add a 
line of text to the license whenever we feel like it. Our only recourse is to 
build linuxdcpp without SSL support. I will commit a fix soon that will add a 
compile flag to enable/disable SSL.

By the way, what is the cut off date to get an updated linuxdcpp version in 
Lenny? We'd like to get 1.0.2 out soon.

Well, I think it's true for significant portion of code, I wouldn't believe a 
oneliner give you such rights.

However, clearly it's an issue in DC++ side. The minimal thing that could be 
done is to ask the author of the code that implements SSL to change the 
licence there. Other file's license could remain the same...

That could be a work around for sure !

Well, the freeze is supposed to happen very soon (mid-july..)

I'm not sure how much the following is (legally) valid, but DC++ have "This
program is licensed under GPL-2 with the notable exception that you may
compile it with OpenSSL (www.openssl.org). " in its License.txt.
Additionally, OpenSSL's license is included in the source package.

Right !!!

So, the DC++ license *does* accept SSL link, only it was not refered in the 
headers shipped in the source code file (at least in linuxdcpp).

Now, I believe it's just a matter of changing linuxdcpp's license.

Hi,

I didn't realize DC++ already has this exemption. This makes things a lot 
simpler. Although I know that some people might disagree with changing a license 
without approval in principle, I think in this instance it should be fine to 
change linuxdcpp's license to add this exemption. I bet if I was to literally 
email each person and ask for their approval, no one would have an issue with 
adding an exemption to link to OpenSSL (since we already do it now). So if no 
one objects to it, I will make this change tomorrow.

Which headers are you specifically talking about? Perhaps we can change
DC++'s source code to incorporate the exemption (if the changes are not
system-wide).

Subject: [Linuxdcpp-developers] [Bug #14272] 1.0.2: can not browse files
	without TTH
Message-ID: <200807262240.m6QMem1K020466@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #14272, was updated on 2008-Jul-27 01:40
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: LinuxDC++
Category: None
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: None
Priority: 5
Submitted by: vlad_gh
Assigned to : none
Summary: 1.0.2: can not browse files without TTH

Details: 
Some filelists do not include a TTH attribute for the File elements.
( see fragment at the end ).

In function ListLoader::startTag(), such File elements are ignored.
( if(h.empty() { return; } )

Is it possible to process such Files, in order to increase interoperability with other clients ?

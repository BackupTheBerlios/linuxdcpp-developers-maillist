<PRE>Good (hmm...) evening everybody :)

So, I'd like to suggest some minor LinuxDC++ improvements. I know these
improvements are not critical, but by making these patches I'll beter
understand what's going on in LinuxDC++ project and it's quite reasonable
for me to start with something like this :)

So, I've two ideas:

1) Finished Uploads. It's not very usable for me when some clients download
files by parts. The &quot;Finished Uploads&quot; log shows many records with the same
{user, file, hub} and different {time, size, speed}. This overhead depends
on size of downloaded file and can be very very big. That's why it's quite
difficult to look through this log. I think it would be much better if we'll
merge records with the same {user, file, hub} by updating time to the
latest, by summation of sizes and by averaging download speed. May be it is
reasonable to make this logging mode optional ;)

2) Searching. Well. When I tried LinuxDC++, the first thought was: how do
they guess the file types? When I choose to search for &quot;Video&quot;, what video
files would be accepted? Yesterday I looked through
ShareManager::initTypeMap() and understood that extensions are hardcoded ;)
May be it is cool to provide some kind of categories editor?

I can try to make these patches. Btw, it was a long time ago when I used to
make C/C++ code and I'd like to make something easy for the first time :)

Waiting for your comments :)

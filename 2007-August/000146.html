Hello,

Thanks for your comments. One of the things you have to understand about 
LinuxDC++ is that it is split into two parts: the DC++ core and the GUI. The 
DC++ core (client/ folder) is copied from the windows version and any changes 
made to it are generally only to make it better support *nix platforms. These 
changes are then set upstream to DC++ for approval and hopefully added into 
their source. Any changes to the GUI is controlled by us, so there's no problem 
there.

Both of the changes you mentioned are DC++ core changes that are not *nix 
specific bugs. Thus, if you want to make those changes you'd have to get DC++ to 
approve them so that they'll make their way into LinuxDC++ the next time we 
upgrade the core.

As far as logging, I'm not sure if you mean the actual log file stored on the 
hard disk or if you mean the finished uploads tab in the gui. It's not practical 
to go back through the physical log file and merge entries since the log file 
entries are just appended each time and the file can get quite large. If you 
mean the finished upload tab, then it's a bit more easy to implement. But 
considering DC++ doesn't even officially support partial file uploads, I don't 
think adding support for it in finished uploads would be something upstream 
would accept.

If you think the file types is bad now, you should've seen it before the patch 
to make ShareManager::checkTypes endian-safe (it also added a ton more file 
extensions to check). Upstream still hasn't accepted that patch we sent them.

I'm not trying to discourage you, just letting you know it's probably better to 
focus on changes in the gui or *nix-specific bugs in the core if you want them 
to make their way into LinuxDC++.

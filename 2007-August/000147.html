Hello :)

I know about core/GUI. I've read some comments for LinuxDC++ feature
requests.

But I don't think that we need to improve DC++ core. I think it's enough to
make some GUI changes (Finished uploads tab) to improve logs presentaion (to
make it easier for perception). As I understand I need only to patch
FinishedTransfers::addItem_gui(StringMap params, bool update) and it will be
enough :) Am I right? Finally, many users in my network connects, downloads
a part of the file, disconnects and connects again. May be partial upload is
not supported but it seems to work okay :) Which special support is needed?

The problem with file types is a bit more complicated. I thought that search
function in the backend of P2P client is about to be a simple one. I thought
we have the same situation with file types and file type is a something that
is under our control because I don't see any reason file type to be used in
DC++ core. But I've looked through DC++ core code more carefully and now I
understand that my first ideas were not right. I'll think about it again :)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Good (hmm...) evening everybody :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, I'd like to suggest some minor LinuxDC++ improvements. I know these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; improvements are not critical, but by making these patches I'll beter
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; understand what's going on in LinuxDC++ project and it's quite
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reasonable for me to start with something like this :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, I've two ideas:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) Finished Uploads. It's not very usable for me when some clients
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; download files by parts. The &quot;Finished Uploads&quot; log shows many records
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with the same {user, file, hub} and different {time, size, speed}. This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; overhead depends on size of downloaded file and can be very very big.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's why it's quite difficult to look through this log. I think it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be much better if we'll merge records with the same {user, file,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hub} by updating time to the latest, by summation of sizes and by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; averaging download speed. May be it is reasonable to make this logging
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mode optional ;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) Searching. Well. When I tried LinuxDC++, the first thought was: how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; do they guess the file types? When I choose to search for &quot;Video&quot;, what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; video files would be accepted? Yesterday I looked through
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ShareManager::initTypeMap() and understood that extensions are hardcoded
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ;) May be it is cool to provide some kind of categories editor?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can try to make these patches. Btw, it was a long time ago when I used
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to make C/C++ code and I'd like to make something easy for the first
</I>&gt;<i> time :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Waiting for your comments :)

</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your comments. One of the things you have to understand about
</I>&gt;<i> LinuxDC++ is that it is split into two parts: the DC++ core and the GUI.
</I>&gt;<i> The
</I>&gt;<i> DC++ core (client/ folder) is copied from the windows version and any
</I>&gt;<i> changes
</I>&gt;<i> made to it are generally only to make it better support *nix platforms.
</I>&gt;<i> These
</I>&gt;<i> changes are then set upstream to DC++ for approval and hopefully added
</I>&gt;<i> into
</I>&gt;<i> their source. Any changes to the GUI is controlled by us, so there's no
</I>&gt;<i> problem
</I>&gt;<i> there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Both of the changes you mentioned are DC++ core changes that are not *nix
</I>&gt;<i> specific bugs. Thus, if you want to make those changes you'd have to get
</I>&gt;<i> DC++ to
</I>&gt;<i> approve them so that they'll make their way into LinuxDC++ the next time
</I>&gt;<i> we
</I>&gt;<i> upgrade the core.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as logging, I'm not sure if you mean the actual log file stored on
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> hard disk or if you mean the finished uploads tab in the gui. It's not
</I>&gt;<i> practical
</I>&gt;<i> to go back through the physical log file and merge entries since the log
</I>&gt;<i> file
</I>&gt;<i> entries are just appended each time and the file can get quite large. If
</I>&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;<i> mean the finished upload tab, then it's a bit more easy to implement. But
</I>&gt;<i> considering DC++ doesn't even officially support partial file uploads, I
</I>&gt;<i> don't
</I>&gt;<i> think adding support for it in finished uploads would be something
</I>&gt;<i> upstream
</I>&gt;<i> would accept.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you think the file types is bad now, you should've seen it before the
</I>&gt;<i> patch
</I>&gt;<i> to make ShareManager::checkTypes endian-safe (it also added a ton more
</I>&gt;<i> file
</I>&gt;<i> extensions to check). Upstream still hasn't accepted that patch we sent
</I>&gt;<i> them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not trying to discourage you, just letting you know it's probably
</I>&gt;<i> better to
</I>&gt;<i> focus on changes in the gui or *nix-specific bugs in the core if you want
</I>&gt;<i> them
</I>&gt;<i> to make their way into LinuxDC++.
</I>&gt;<i>

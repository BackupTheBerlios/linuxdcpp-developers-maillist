Well, I've just subscribed to mailing list, so I've read these messages from
the archives. Unfortunately I've only lo and one eth interface on my
computer.

Thank you for your reply!

So, I'll try to follow your advices and to make some patches when I'll
understand LinuxDC++ code enough. I've already checked out the latest
repository version (I was using the old one before and it used to crash
after some hours) and first of all I'll try to test if the new one crashes
too.

Unfortunately I've not enough experience with Gtk, but I'll try to learn it.
Can you suggest any good docs on Gtk?

Subject: [Linuxdcpp-developers] Disconnect when a file list is uploaded
Message-ID: <BAY144-F6479EC4ADC47C2FC5DDB1FF600@phx.gbl>

I wanted to report that when a user requests my file list, after it is 
uploaded all connections are disconnected, downloads aborted. Linuxdcpp will 
reconnect to all servers, however, it is UNable to reconnect to any peer a 
download is being retrieved from. All download or connection activity is 
hindered. However, others can still retrieve from me.

This is recorded in a server's window when my file list is retrieved:

*** Connect failed: Interrupted system call
*** Connecting
*** Connected

The status bar error is : HH:MM Listening socket failed (you need to restart 
DC++)...Interrupted system call.

However, no outgoing connections to other peers is possible. I must shut 
down linuxdcpp and restart it. This occurs every time.

I am behind a firewall, but am able to have an active connection to port 
1412 since it is port forwarded.

I only began looking at this product since 02/2007 and both cvs updates show 
this problem, HTH

I think I've seen this before. I believe this is caused by a bug in socket error 
handling. ConnectionManager::accept() should retry instead of exiting if errno 
equals EINTR. I've had it on my "todo" list for awhile, but don't have any time 
to work on it. Hopefully someone else can look into it and submit a patch.

I've looked into this some, and I think it's the select call in 
Socket::wait that cause the problem.

I've created a patch that might solve the problem, but since it does not 
occur for me I cannot
verify if it helps or not - please try it out and report the result 
(patch ID on berlios is #1953).

Br,
Mikael Eman

Sadly, the patch has the same result. Total disconnect and error message 
plus inability to reconnect to anyone on download list.

*** Connect failed: Interrupted system call
*** Connecting
*** Connected

and [HH:MM] Listening socket failed (you need to restart DC++): Interrupted 
System Call.

Actually this isn't so bad after all, since the patch I submitted really couldn't solve the
problem (sorry for that, don't know what I was thinking or even if I was thinking ;-)

Anyway, I will submit a new patch with better chances to fix the problem tonight.

Patch #1953 has been updated.

Project: linuxdcpp
Category: None
Status: Open
Submitted by: pemiem
Assigned to : none
Summary: Possible fix for "disconnect when a file is uploaded"

This patch works. The problem seems to be removed. File list retrieves go 
smoothly without interrupting pending or current downloads. I had others on 
the hub help test while I did other things. Current uploads and downloads 
are unaffected.

After a file list upload completes, the connection shows idle for approx 2 
minutes. Is that the normal timeout?

One comment. When a file list is retrieved, it does not show in Finished 
Uploads. Is that normal?

Thank you all very much!

I can't say if two minutes is exactly correct, but that sounds about right
for the old behaviour.

You need to enable "Log filelist transfers" to have file lists show up in
the finished downloads/uploads window. (This is intentional.) The option is
off by default, and I actually can't see it in LinuxDC++'s GUI. One of the
few unimplemented (yet, hopefully - shouldn't be difficult to add) features.

I've implemented it on my local copy. It'll be in next CVS. Keep bug reports

Subject: [Linuxdcpp-developers] Magnet links support
Message-ID: <46212F57.6030409@gmail.com>

Hello,

	I'd like to ask about status of magnet links support that already was 
discussed some months ago.
	Previous result was that magnet links seemed useless despite arguments 
by the original author of patch for magnet support Max Laplan(by the 
way, thanks for the patch! :) It works flawlessly), despite that it is 
implemented in many windows Direct Connect clients(if it is useless - 
why it was implemented there ? Obvious reason - because there are common 
use cases to utilize it), despite that for query "linuxdcpp magnet" 
google returns quite modest but anyway significant amount of results in 
the light of decision whether it is useful or not. I could describe my 
own use case for magnet links if this possibly can help to move for at 
least a bit decision to positive side but hardly it will be something 
new and should be already known one.
	So what is the current status of all this and what could be done from 
users and developers side to help accept magnet links patch to main tree ?

Regards, Alex

Hello, Alex,

the last agreement with Steven was to include magnets support in CVS
right after the 1.0. 

Before that, latest patch is available here http://linuxdcpp-ru.sf.net.

Bug #10890, was updated on 2007-Apr-15 13:23
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: LinuxDC++
Category: None
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: None
Priority: 5
Submitted by: assasukasse
Assigned to : none
Summary: LinuxDc++ eats up all upload band.

Details: I noticed that there is no option to reduce to a reasonable level the band used in upload by linuxdc++. This causes severe lags, and makes almost impossible for me to browse the net, not talking about istant messaging, that keeps disconnecting.
I would strongly suggest a system to link upload and download rates, so that is possible to reduce the upload to a reasonable level, otherwise it will be very difficult for me to keep using this application: i can only let it run at night when i don't need to use the computer, otherwise slows things down so much that i feel like i am on an old 28800modem..

Summary: Move of tree in dl queue flattens the tree

Details: In the download queue, when moving files in several subdirectories from one target dl directory to another, the tree is flattened.

E.g.:

/incoming_disk1 has the following:
 - Directory1
   - Subdirectory1
      - file1
   - Subdirectory2
      - file2

and move Directory1 to another target the structure gets flattened thus:
/incoming_disk2
 - file1
 - file2

Summary: Long MOTD message let's downloading fail?

Details: The hub I connect to has changed to have a very long MOTD (Message Of The Day). This was the only change since the last time I connected and downloaded successfully from it. So, I suspect that something in that area went wrong. I have the latest CVS version (20070324) on an FC4 system. I ran the linuxdcpp with debug. Output below (IP has been masked out). A previous version (CVS version 20061012) has no problems...

right click on user in the main chat to send pm or
public message
useful in private hubs with nick prefixes like [REG] so
you don`t need to write for example [REG]ni tab

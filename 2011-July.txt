Subject: [Linuxdcpp-developers] linuxdcpp moving entire directories to the
	FileLists dir
Message-ID: <2541672.LMHmbrJadP@horus>

Hello,

since the upgrade to linuxdcpp 1.1.0 on arch linux I've twice encountered a 
strange bug.

In both cases contents of entire directories on the home filesystem have been 
moved to a directory in .dc++/FileLists, named like 
"rainer.HJGE3UITRXWHLGJYEUXZOOWFWDTGE3BBCMSTRKY".

For the first time it was my entire music folder (~100GB) which is shared.

For the second time it was my Downloads directory. My directory hierarchy 
looks like that:

~/Downloads/DC   <-- download target, folder not shared
~/Downloads/DC/.incoming
~/Downloads/DC/shared

The contents of the entire Downloads folder, including the DC subfolder was 
moved.

I got no idea on which event it happend nor how to reproduce it.

For the first time it was very shocking to me, seeing all my music having 
disappeared.

I'll be happy to provide any more information,

Florian

LinuxDC++ no longer uses berlios. Please open a bug on our launchpad
site https://bugs.launchpad.net/linuxdcpp. Please attach your ~/.dc
++/DCPlusPlus.xml to the bug as well. I'm guessing this may be some
profile migration issue between 1.0.3 -> 1.1.0 that we missed. In
particular the settings dialog was modified pretty heavily and your
description sounds like a trailing / is missing on some directory
somewhere.

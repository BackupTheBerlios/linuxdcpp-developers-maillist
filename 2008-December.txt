Subject: [Linuxdcpp-developers] Port to Solaris?
Message-ID: <787494.27074.qm@web51407.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

I wonder, is it much work to port LinuxDC++ to Solaris? Can it easily be done, or should I forget about it? Is there any patch available?

Regards,
Sean

Hi,

It shouldn't be much work to port it to Solaris. No one has worked on this yet 
that I know of. Give it a shot if you want and let us know how it turns out. If 
you have to make any code changes we'd appreciate it if you'd attach it to a bug 
on our Launchpad site (https://launchpad.net/linuxdcpp).

Hi,

I actually did the changes that was needed to run linuxdcpp on Solaris,
but I never made a patch for it (shame on me!).

As I remember it there was some function, a few defines and some flag to
ld that wasn't available on Solaris (at least not
on my setup) that I had to make changes for. I have probably forgotten
something (and something else might have been
introduced), but if you ask me I'd say it can easily be done ..

Br,
Mikael Eman

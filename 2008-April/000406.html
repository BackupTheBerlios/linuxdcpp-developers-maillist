<PRE>Hi,

The LinuxDCPP will eventually move to the latest stable dc++ core (0.705). 
There is a branch for it in launchpad  
<A HREF="https://code.launchpad.net/~razzloss/linuxdcpp/0705-core">https://code.launchpad.net/~razzloss/linuxdcpp/0705-core</A>

Instructions and requirements:
Bazaar
Boost libraries (not sure about the required version, 1.34 seems to work)
and gcc 4.1

to checkout the branch use: bzr branch 
<A HREF="http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~razzloss/linuxdcpp/0705-core">http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~razzloss/linuxdcpp/0705-core</A>

and build with scons (preferably with debug=1, but it's up to you)


It would be greatly appreciated, if you could build and test the branch, and 
report any regressions to me (either directly (email or irc 
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/linuxdcpp-developers">linuxdc++ at freenode</A>) or via this list). As our plan is to do a minimal upgrade  
== have all the old functionality with the new core and later take advantage 
of the new features. 

Currently know problems are:
* Usercommands are disabled (will probably be fixed soon)
* Transferview requires some work. It's rather hard to follow the status of 
multisource downloads.  (you can use dlqueue for that)
* And when resuming transfer, it seems that it begins from 0%, but actually 
file size is reported as Size - Last position. So resuming is working 
correctly.
* I haven't even attempted to use the new translation features...

But other than that, it has worked for my use for now. Though I'm rather 
limited on hubs I can use (only one). So I'm asking you to test it and report 
any problems so that we can (at some point) merge it to the main branch.

Thanks,
Razzloss

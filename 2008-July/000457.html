<PRE>Le Tuesday 01 July 2008 05:45:25 Steven Sheehy, vous avez &#233;crit&#160;:
&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>
	Hi !

&gt;<i> It is not so simple as you say. Firstly, since we embed DC++ core code in
</I>&gt;<i> our code instead of linking to it, DC++ would have to change their license
</I>&gt;<i> as well. Secondly, linuxdcpp cannot change the license since we would have
</I>&gt;<i> to get the permission of every person who has ever submitted a patch. We
</I>&gt;<i> cannot just add a line of text to the license whenever we feel like it. 
</I>
Well, I think it's true for significant portion of code, I wouldn't believe a 
oneliner give you such rights.

However, clearly it's an issue in DC++ side. The minimal thing that could be 
done is to ask the author of the code that implements SSL to change the 
licence there. Other file's license could remain the same...

&gt;<i> Our only recourse is to build linuxdcpp without SSL support. I will commit a
</I>&gt;<i> fix soon that will add a compile flag to enable/disable SSL.
</I>
That could be a work around for sure !

&gt;<i> By the way, what is the cut off date to get an updated linuxdcpp version in
</I>&gt;<i> Lenny? We'd like to get 1.0.2 out soon.
</I>
Well, the freeze is supposed to happen very soon (mid-july..) 


Romain

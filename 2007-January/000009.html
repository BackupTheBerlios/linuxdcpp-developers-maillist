&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks for the patch. In the future, you should probably ask if such a

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and no one responded in the affirmative. We may have ported DC++ to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; linux, but we don't plan on implementing all features of it. It is better

&gt;<i> &gt; Unless people respond to this thread saying that such a feature

I'm all for this patch.
But I must say that a short note on IRC hardly catches all users of linuxdc++.

Nice to hear, any ETA

&gt;<i> &gt; bug fixes at the moment. I hope rejecting your patch doesn't put you off

That doesn't mean it has to be rejected just delayed (change to svn...).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, no ;-). I've made this primarily for my own comfort. Since
</I>&gt;<i> October I am maintaining such unofficial linuxdcpp changes, and if you
</I>&gt;<i> find them usefull sometime in future, they can be found here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://linuxdcpp-ru.sf.net">http://linuxdcpp-ru.sf.net</A> (there is no page, just a bunch of patches,
</I>&gt;<i> sorry).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In any way, I'll announce all such changes in maillist/patch tracker.

Added as a bookmark :)

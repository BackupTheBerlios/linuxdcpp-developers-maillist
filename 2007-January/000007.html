</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the patch. In the future, you should probably ask if such a 
</I>&gt;<i> feature would be accepted before making such a big patch. I don't really 
</I>&gt;<i> see the need for adding magnet link support, it seems a bit useless to me. 
</I>&gt;<i> I asked in the IRC channel if anyone else would want magnet support and no 
</I>&gt;<i> one responded in the affirmative. We may have ported DC++ to linux, but we 
</I>&gt;<i> don't plan on implementing all features of it. It is better to keep things 
</I>&gt;<i> simple and efficient.
</I>
In DC hubs I use regulary, magnets are de-facto standard, because it's
the only comfortable way to exchange DC links and they are implemented
on all win32 clients.

I've posted this patch announce today in russian discussion board and
at least 3 people find it useful.

&gt;<i> Unless people respond to this thread saying that such a feature
</I>&gt;<i> would be desirable, I don't think I can accept this patch.
</I>
In that case it would be better to post message in maillist, instead
of private ;-).

&gt;<i> We are trying to gear up for a release soon and are mainly looking for bug 
</I>&gt;<i> fixes at the moment. I hope rejecting your patch doesn't put you off on 
</I>&gt;<i> working on any future patches.
</I>
Of course, no ;-). I've made this primarily for my own comfort. Since
October I am maintaining such unofficial linuxdcpp changes, and if you
find them usefull sometime in future, they can be found here:
<A HREF="http://linuxdcpp-ru.sf.net">http://linuxdcpp-ru.sf.net</A> (there is no page, just a bunch of patches,
sorry).

In any way, I'll announce all such changes in maillist/patch tracker.

<PRE>Hello.

</I>Could you please give me a quick hint
where to look for that in a gui? The
thing is that I've found nothing in the
GUI related to magnet (except &quot;Copy magnet&quot;),
while in the patch I can see a few magnet-
related config settings for instance. And
this:
+      &lt;widget class=&quot;GtkMenuItem&quot; id=&quot;searchMagnetItem&quot;&gt;
is where?

&gt;<i> The ability to pass magnet
</I>&gt;<i> links from another application to linuxdcpp (e.g. registering linuxdcpp
</I>&gt;<i> as the OS default magnet uri handler) has not been implemented. It was
</I>&gt;<i> not part of the original patch either.
</I>Oh. :(

&gt;<i> You can always copy the magnet
</I>&gt;<i> and paste it into linuxdcpp, but this is probably not what you are
</I>&gt;<i> expecting.
</I>I'd like that too - how to do? The only way
I've found, is to paste it into a chat and
then click on it, which is of course not what
I was expecting, but is there any other way?

&gt;<i> A patch to add this feature is welcome as long as it is done
</I>&gt;<i> in a way that is OS &amp; desktop environment independent.
</I>Passing the magnet link as a command-line
argument can probably be easily done in
an OS-independant way. But I guess also some
GUI additions are needed. Like the explicit
&quot;Open magnet link&quot; dialog somewhere and maybe
a new search option. But that's what I think
was in an original patch, so I am not sure if
it is still missing or not. At least I was not
able to find anything magnet-related in the GUI.

Well, maybe...but that's why I told you it was a workaround and that magnet uri 
registering was not implemented yet.

&gt;<i> Thank you for explanation.

Maybe I'm missing something, but what's the purpose of support other magnet 
types besides TTH? DC++ doesn't recognize sha1 or other hash methods.

Of course, patches are always welcome. I don't think what you propose is what 
I'd like to see implemented, though. Both your ideas sound like workarounds to 
the whole concept of registering linuxdcpp as the default OS magnet handler. The 
dialog is to create a magnet link when linuxdcpp is already open and the command 
line is to open a new instance of linuxdcpp with the magnet. You cannot use the 
command line feature for an already open instance and you cannot use the dialog 
when linuxdcpp is not open. As I said before, I would like to see an OS/desktop 
independent way to register linuxdcpp as the default OS magnet handler so that 
it opens linuxdcpp if it's not already open and if it is open it handles the 
magnet appropriately.

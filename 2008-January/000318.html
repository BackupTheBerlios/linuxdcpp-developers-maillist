Stas, we are both russians so we know very well what does that mean when someone
says big words instead of doing something real. I am not going to play a role
of anyone's advocate but if you had a look into the code of the magnet
patch you should get an idea that the interface part of it was a secondary
thing when copared to the other more low-level tasks the patch does.

I would recommend you to start coding right now instead of making too much
self-advertising noise ;) In this case we all will be happier, right?

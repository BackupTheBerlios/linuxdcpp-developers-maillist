<PRE>Hello.

&gt;<i> You can copy a magnet from, say, a file list then paste it into the main

</I>But isn't it silly to post the link
to the chat only to click it? That's
what I've figured after spending the
whole day (and thanks to google), so
its a way counter-intuitive too.

&gt;<i> When you right click the magnet you can search for the magnet,

</I>&gt;<i> magnet.glade).
</I>Thank you for explanation.
Well, this dialog looks pretty much
unhelpfull to me though...
Also it does look like not all magnets
are even recognized. For example, the
magnet like this:
magnet:?xt=urn:sha1:YNCKHTQCWBTRNJIV4WNAE52SJUQCZO5C
is not recognized. This is probably a bug.

&gt;&gt;<i> I've found, is to paste it into a chat and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then click on it, which is of course not what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I was expecting, but is there any other way?
</I>&gt;<i> Nope.
</I>Are you interested in a further work in
this area? I can't promise anything, but
I may happen to have a look.
What I would like to implement, is a
text dialog for conviniently entering the
magnet links, and the command-line argument
for the same purpose, so that the linuxdcpp
can be used as an URL handler with firefox.
I know that the initial magnet support went
in with troubles, so that's why I am asking
beforehand. :)

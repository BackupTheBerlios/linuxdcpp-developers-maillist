<PRE>Hi.

I am new to linuxdcpp. I started to use it
because the magnet links support was recently
announced. However, I spent the whole day
trying to figure out where that support
actually is, and it was in vain.
Then I started to look into the appropriate
patch:
<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/patch/download.php?id=2204">http://developer.berlios.de/patch/download.php?id=2204</A>
and it seems to me that it was applied either
partially or not at all. For example, there
supposed to be a new dialog window:
--- linuxdcpp/glade/magnet.glade	1970-01-01 03:00:00.000000000 +0300
+++ linuxdcpp-test/glade/magnet.glade	2007-10-07 20:06:58.000000000 +0400
but browsing the CVS sources, I don't see the
magnet.glade file here:
<A HREF="http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/linuxdcpp/linuxdcpp/glade/">http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/linuxdcpp/linuxdcpp/glade/</A>
A quick look over some other changes also
suggests they are not there. The patch is
marked as Accepted though...

So my question is: was the magnet support actually
added? And if so - how to pass the magnet links
to linuxdcpp now?
Well, I can see the ability to _export_ the magnet
links - that's certainly nice, but not what I was
looking for.

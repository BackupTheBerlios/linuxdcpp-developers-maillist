The patch was accepted and added to cvs, but not without major modifications. 
For example, the magnet.glade you mentioned was not included but instead moved 
to another file. The ability to pass magnet links from another application to 
linuxdcpp (e.g. registering linuxdcpp as the OS default magnet uri handler) has 
not been implemented. It was not part of the original patch either. You can 
always copy the magnet and paste it into linuxdcpp, but this is probably not 
what you are expecting. A patch to add this feature is welcome as long as it is 
done in a way that is OS &amp; desktop environment independent.

<PRE>Hello.

</I>I guess only a command-line parameter is a
work-around for that. And it will have another
problems too, eg what to do if there are no
hubs to auto-connect? Then the passed magnet
cannot be handled immediately.
But the entry dialog is not for that. Its
just so that the one can at least conviniently
copy/paste the magnets to linuxdcpp. Unless
even this is possible, I would say the magnet
support is basically non-existant.

&gt;<i> not open. As I said before, I would like to see an OS/desktop
</I>&gt;<i> independent way to register linuxdcpp as the default OS magnet handler
</I>&gt;<i> so that it opens linuxdcpp if it's not already open and if it is open it
</I>&gt;<i> handles the magnet appropriately.
</I>Unfortunately I am not aware of any. The
OS-dependant ways do exist, but could you
point me to an independant one that really
works everywhere?
Anyway, not what I wanted to see for the
first pass at least.
Leaving the command line aside, can we
have at least the entry for copy/pasting
magnets? The assumption that everyone just
wants to click an URL is probably wrong -
maybe I wrote it down to paper and want to
type directly into linuxdcpp. :)
Of course the handler support would be good,
but it is not there and is unlikely to
happen soon, so why dismissing all the other
ways that can be implemented and used right
now?

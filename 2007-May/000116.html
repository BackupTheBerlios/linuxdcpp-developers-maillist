<PRE>Hello,

First off, great app.  I has come a long way since I first found it.
Right now I have two majour annoyances with it, the first being when
switching tabs the courser does not go to the typing area.  This causes
one to have to click down in the area to type each time the user
switches between tabs.  The second is the lack of (or apparent lack of)
op commands.  Maybe I am just missing them, but I cannot find them if
they need switched on.

These are basically the only problems that I have been having lately
with ldcpp, keep up the great work!

-Frank

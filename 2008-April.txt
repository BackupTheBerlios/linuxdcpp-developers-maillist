Subject: [Linuxdcpp-developers] One more feature wanted
Message-ID: <1207116257.11253.8.camel@azd.alexbank.fin>

Feature about using commands with OpChat reports, now, when we got a
report about something, we need to copy his nick/ip and in the main
window do what we want with him by hand, so, wanted that in Everyone
window right-clicking on username - shows default user menu, 
If it could be done - the same for ip.
Thanks.

Subject: [Linuxdcpp-developers] Fwd: Testers for 0.705-core with Linuxdcpp
Message-ID: <200804042259.35730.Razzloss@gmail.com>

Hi,

The LinuxDCPP will eventually move to the latest stable dc++ core (0.705). 
There is a branch for it in launchpad  
https://code.launchpad.net/~razzloss/linuxdcpp/0705-core

Instructions and requirements:
Bazaar
Boost libraries (not sure about the required version, 1.34 seems to work)
and gcc 4.1

to checkout the branch use: bzr branch 
http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~razzloss/linuxdcpp/0705-core

and build with scons (preferably with debug=1, but it's up to you)


It would be greatly appreciated, if you could build and test the branch, and 
report any regressions to me (either directly (email or irc 
linuxdc++ at freenode) or via this list). As our plan is to do a minimal upgrade  
== have all the old functionality with the new core and later take advantage 
of the new features. 

Currently know problems are:
* Usercommands are disabled (will probably be fixed soon)
* Transferview requires some work. It's rather hard to follow the status of 
multisource downloads.  (you can use dlqueue for that)
* And when resuming transfer, it seems that it begins from 0%, but actually 
file size is reported as Size - Last position. So resuming is working 
correctly.
* I haven't even attempted to use the new translation features...

But other than that, it has worked for my use for now. Though I'm rather 
limited on hubs I can use (only one). So I'm asking you to test it and report 
any problems so that we can (at some point) merge it to the main branch.

Thanks,
Razzloss

PS. Sorry if this gets delivered twice (sent it once to 
linux.. at bat.berlios.de, but it seems its not delivered (or its just as 
slow...))

A new option is introduced which controls whether the
user wants to see the tray popup window when moving the
mouse onto the tray icon, or not.

If this option is not set and the window is minimized,
then upload and download calculations are skipped which
is a little performance improvement. (In each second a
timer event initiates the speed calculation in
linux/mainwindow.cc)

The new setting is placed in wulfor and can be set in
Preferences/Appearance/Options, under the scrollwindow.
After changing this setting the application should be
restarted.

The core remains unmodified.

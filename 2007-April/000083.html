I think I've seen this before. I believe this is caused by a bug in socket error 
handling. ConnectionManager::accept() should retry instead of exiting if errno 
equals EINTR. I've had it on my &quot;todo&quot; list for awhile, but don't have any time 
to work on it. Hopefully someone else can look into it and submit a patch.

<PRE>Hello,

	I'd like to ask about status of magnet links support that already was 
discussed some months ago.
	Previous result was that magnet links seemed useless despite arguments 
by the original author of patch for magnet support Max Laplan(by the 
way, thanks for the patch! :) It works flawlessly), despite that it is 
implemented in many windows Direct Connect clients(if it is useless - 
why it was implemented there ? Obvious reason - because there are common 
use cases to utilize it), despite that for query &quot;linuxdcpp magnet&quot; 
google returns quite modest but anyway significant amount of results in 
the light of decision whether it is useful or not. I could describe my 
own use case for magnet links if this possibly can help to move for at 
least a bit decision to positive side but hardly it will be something 
new and should be already known one.
	So what is the current status of all this and what could be done from 
users and developers side to help accept magnet links patch to main tree ?

Regards, Alex

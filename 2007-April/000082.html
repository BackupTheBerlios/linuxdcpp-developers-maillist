<PRE>I wanted to report that when a user requests my file list, after it is 
uploaded all connections are disconnected, downloads aborted. Linuxdcpp will 
reconnect to all servers, however, it is UNable to reconnect to any peer a 
download is being retrieved from. All download or connection activity is 
hindered. However, others can still retrieve from me.

This is recorded in a server's window when my file list is retrieved:

*** Connect failed: Interrupted system call
*** Connecting
*** Connected

The status bar error is : HH:MM Listening socket failed (you need to restart 
DC++)...Interrupted system call.

However, no outgoing connections to other peers is possible. I must shut 
down linuxdcpp and restart it. This occurs every time.

I am behind a firewall, but am able to have an active connection to port 
1412 since it is port forwarded.

I only began looking at this product since 02/2007 and both cvs updates show 
this problem, HTH

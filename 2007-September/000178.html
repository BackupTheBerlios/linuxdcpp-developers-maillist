<PRE>Hello,
I am an end user basically so feel free to disregard me, but since you  
have released 1.0.0, I hope the situation has changed.
I am on Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) and i try to install linuxDC++ iwth sudo  
scons install but it gives me:
cons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...

scons: *** Source `linuxdcpp' not found, needed by target  
`/usr/local/bin/linuxdcpp'.  Stop.
scons: building terminated because of errors.

I do not understand scons one bit, but I tried to look for linuxdcpp in  
the tarball and there is no such file. I retrieved it from  
<A HREF="tp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/linuxdcpp/">tp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/linuxdcpp/</A> (tried both gz and bz2).

I compiled cvs version of LinuxDC++ several months ago without any  
problems. But now upgrade seems to not work anymore.

I uninstalled the earlier version, even though it took me some time to  
figure out that -c option is needed. A mention about uninstalling would be  
nice in the readme, I guess not that many people are so familiar with  
scons.

BTW: the earlier version I was running was great, certainly much better  
than something through wine.

Regards,
Tomas Hnyk

Good day, LinuxDC++ team!

Well, first of all, I'd like to make some excuses for my English, I've not
enough practice in it :)

I am LinuxDC++ user since I tried Linux on my home PC.

What I can do for you and LinuxDC++:

1) Some non-critical development. I have some experience in C/C++ and POSIX
threads but it may require much time to understand how system works and so
on.
2) Perform some LinuxDC++ testing in my network before commit
3) I could make some l10n (Russian)
4) May be something else. Feel free asking me if I can help :)


Although I've found (known?) bug:
 - Search doesn't work for me in active connection mode

Does your PC have several network interfaces with different IPs?
Please check if the last CVS works for you.

Hello,

Thanks for the offer of assistance. We can always use more contributors and any 
help you can give is very much appreciated.

If you want to contribute, the best way is just to find bugs and submit patches 
to fix them. There's some bugs listed in our bug tracker, or you can test the 
program to try to find some. You can also check the changelog and test for 
regressions after a commit (like Stanislav mentioned in the other email). 
There's also features in the feature request tracker you can implement if you'd 
like. Documentation on the code structure, etc. is on our wiki 
(http://openfacts.berlios.de/index-en.phtml?title=LinuxDC%2B%2B). Currently 
we're still trying to add l10n support to the code so we don't need translations 
quite yet. I'd also recommend joining our irc channel if you want to get more 
involved. Hopefully this helps!

Thanks,
Steven Sheehy

Well, I've just subscribed to mailing list, so I've read these messages from
the archives. Unfortunately I've only lo and one eth interface on my
computer.

Thank you for your reply!

So, I'll try to follow your advices and to make some patches when I'll
understand LinuxDC++ code enough. I've already checked out the latest
repository version (I was using the old one before and it used to crash
after some hours) and first of all I'll try to test if the new one crashes
too.

Unfortunately I've not enough experience with Gtk, but I'll try to learn it.
Can you suggest any good docs on Gtk?

It can be also usefull if you file an _informative_ bug report when you notice
that something going wrong with your linuxdcpp.

And i think we would have no problems with translation LinuxDC++ in
Russian. :)

Subject: [Linuxdcpp-developers] Some ideas about minor improvements
Message-ID: <500a54cf0708110816w5051c3b0idd29b11782ff6108@mail.gmail.com>

Good (hmm...) evening everybody :)

So, I'd like to suggest some minor LinuxDC++ improvements. I know these
improvements are not critical, but by making these patches I'll beter
understand what's going on in LinuxDC++ project and it's quite reasonable
for me to start with something like this :)

So, I've two ideas:

1) Finished Uploads. It's not very usable for me when some clients download
files by parts. The "Finished Uploads" log shows many records with the same
{user, file, hub} and different {time, size, speed}. This overhead depends
on size of downloaded file and can be very very big. That's why it's quite
difficult to look through this log. I think it would be much better if we'll
merge records with the same {user, file, hub} by updating time to the
latest, by summation of sizes and by averaging download speed. May be it is
reasonable to make this logging mode optional ;)

2) Searching. Well. When I tried LinuxDC++, the first thought was: how do
they guess the file types? When I choose to search for "Video", what video
files would be accepted? Yesterday I looked through
ShareManager::initTypeMap() and understood that extensions are hardcoded ;)
May be it is cool to provide some kind of categories editor?

I can try to make these patches. Btw, it was a long time ago when I used to
make C/C++ code and I'd like to make something easy for the first time :)

Waiting for your comments :)

Hello,

Thanks for your comments. One of the things you have to understand about 
LinuxDC++ is that it is split into two parts: the DC++ core and the GUI. The 
DC++ core (client/ folder) is copied from the windows version and any changes 
made to it are generally only to make it better support *nix platforms. These 
changes are then set upstream to DC++ for approval and hopefully added into 
their source. Any changes to the GUI is controlled by us, so there's no problem 
there.

Both of the changes you mentioned are DC++ core changes that are not *nix 
specific bugs. Thus, if you want to make those changes you'd have to get DC++ to 
approve them so that they'll make their way into LinuxDC++ the next time we 
upgrade the core.

As far as logging, I'm not sure if you mean the actual log file stored on the 
hard disk or if you mean the finished uploads tab in the gui. It's not practical 
to go back through the physical log file and merge entries since the log file 
entries are just appended each time and the file can get quite large. If you 
mean the finished upload tab, then it's a bit more easy to implement. But 
considering DC++ doesn't even officially support partial file uploads, I don't 
think adding support for it in finished uploads would be something upstream 
would accept.

If you think the file types is bad now, you should've seen it before the patch 
to make ShareManager::checkTypes endian-safe (it also added a ton more file 
extensions to check). Upstream still hasn't accepted that patch we sent them.

I'm not trying to discourage you, just letting you know it's probably better to 
focus on changes in the gui or *nix-specific bugs in the core if you want them 
to make their way into LinuxDC++.

-Steven Sheehy

Hello :)

I know about core/GUI. I've read some comments for LinuxDC++ feature
requests.

But I don't think that we need to improve DC++ core. I think it's enough to
make some GUI changes (Finished uploads tab) to improve logs presentaion (to
make it easier for perception). As I understand I need only to patch
FinishedTransfers::addItem_gui(StringMap params, bool update) and it will be
enough :) Am I right? Finally, many users in my network connects, downloads
a part of the file, disconnects and connects again. May be partial upload is
not supported but it seems to work okay :) Which special support is needed?

The problem with file types is a bit more complicated. I thought that search
function in the backend of P2P client is about to be a simple one. I thought
we have the same situation with file types and file type is a something that
is under our control because I don't see any reason file type to be used in
DC++ core. But I've looked through DC++ core code more carefully and now I
understand that my first ideas were not right. I'll think about it again :)

File types are hard coded to DC++ because of NMDC. This is because the
protocol doesn't allow "I want this and that file type", but instead "I want
video files" (which is quite ambigious, as you've noticed). ADC have this
fixed, while I doubt DC++ support it at the moment.

Submitted by: peppot
Assigned to : none
Summary: 2nd time use of "Download to" does not allow Open click
